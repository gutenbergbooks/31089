<h2>The Subspecies of the Mexican Red-bellied<br />
Squirrel, <i>Sciurus aureogaster</i></h2>

<h4>BY</h4>

<h3>KEITH R. KELSON</h3>


<p>In his excellent taxonomic treatment of the tree squirrels of Mexico
and Central America, Nelson (Proc. Washington Acad. Sci., 1:15-110,
2 pls., May 9, 1899) recognized three subspecies of red-bellied
squirrels, <i>Sciurus aureogaster aureogaster</i> F. Cuvier, <i>Sciurus aureogaster
hypopyrrhus</i> Wagler, and <i>Sciurus aureogaster frumentor</i> Nelson.
In his lists of specimens examined, Nelson (<i>op. cit.</i>:42 and 44)
assigned certain specimens from "mountains near Santo Domingo"
and Guichicovi in Chiapas, and Catemaco in Veracruz, to <i>S. a.
aureogaster</i>, and other specimens from the same localities to <i>S. a.
hypopyrrhus</i>. I originally attempted to study (identify to subspecies)
the series of animals from only three places, but it became
evident that a more extensive study was indicated.</p>

<p>The locality whence the holotype of <i>Sciurus aureogaster aureogaster</i>
was obtained is unknown. Because certain specimens from
Altamira, Tamaulipas, closely resemble Cuvier's figure of the type,
Nelson (<i>op. cit.</i>:41) subsequently designated Altamira as the type
locality. Miniatitlan, Veracruz, was designated by Nelson as the
type locality of <i>S. a. hypopyrrhus</i> because Wagler's description of
the type of that subspecies fitted so well certain of Nelson's specimens
from that place.</p>

<p><i>Sciurus a. hypopyrrhus</i> was said by Nelson (<i>op. cit.</i>:43 and 44) to
differ from <i>S. a. aureogaster</i> in darker color, thinner pelage, much
stiffer and more shining dorsal hairs, slenderer tail with black
predominating, larger and proportionately narrower skull with larger
auditory bullae, each bulla being "slightly constricted just in front
of middle." <i>Sciurus aureogaster</i> varies greatly in intensity of
color and in color-pattern. Fully 30 per cent of the specimens
examined are in some degree melanistic and approximately 20 per cent
of them are completely so. Others are more or less brown; the brown
dulls the usually rufous parts. In many specimens this brown is well
distributed even in the otherwise grizzled areas; in some specimens
it is evenly distributed and in others it is in patches. Indeed,
scarcely any two "normally" colored specimens are alike. Typically,
the intense rufous color characteristic of the underparts in both
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
<i>S. a. aureogaster</i> and <i>S. a. hypopyrrhus</i> is also present on the
costal region and shoulders. Even this distribution of color is highly
variable; some specimens (for example No. 23948 KU, from 3 km. E San
Andres Tuxtla, Veracruz) show no rufous dorsally and others (for
example No. 19307 KU, from 20 km. W Piedras Negras, Veracruz) have the
rufous extending over the legs, sides, and almost all of the dorsum
from the shoulders to the rump except (in some) for an interrupted
median strip of grizzled gray. It is true that specimens from
Miniatitlan are darker than those from Altamira, but this seems not to
be significant taxonomically, because examination of series from other
localities provides no evidence of geographic variation in color
except, possibly, in the frequency of melanism. A series of 13
specimens (Univ. Kansas) from 7 and 8 km. WNW Potrero, Veracruz, for
example, is quite as dark as topotypes of <i>S. a. hypopyrrhus</i> from
Miniatitlan, although the localities of capture are approximately in
the center of the geographic range of <i>S. a. aureogaster</i>. In short,
there seems to be no way to distinguish <i>S. a. hypopyrrhus</i> from <i>S.
a. aureogaster</i> on the basis of color. An unusual amount of variation
exists, but it seems to occur at random. Fixing type localities of the
two subspecies at the places of origin of certain specimens which in
color fit the original descriptions is meaningless because selected
specimens or series from almost any place in the geographic range of
the species would qualify as approximate color-duplicates of the
types.</p>

<p>My findings agree with those of Nelson in that skulls from Miniatitlan
average longer and narrower than those from Altamira, but
this seems not to be significant taxonomically because the series
from Altamira is, to judge from the material I have seen, somewhat
shorter and broader cranially than is "average" for the alleged subspecies
<i>S. a. aureogaster</i>. For example, series from Metlaltoyuca in
Puebla, 3 km. E Axtla in San Luis Potos&iacute;, 8 km. NW Potrero and
20 km. NW Piedras Negras in Veracruz, although obtained from
localities well within the geographic range of <i>S. a. aureogaster</i> (as
outlined by Nelson), all more closely resemble the "topotypes" of
<i>S. a. hypopyrrhus</i> in cranial measurements than they do "topotypes"
of <i>S. a. aureogaster</i>. Conversely, specimens from that part of the
range of <i>S. a. hypopyrrhus</i> most remote from the range of <i>S. a.
aureogaster</i> (Montecristo, La Venta, and Teapa, all in Tabasco)
more closely approximate the Altamiran series in cranial size and
proportions than they do the Miniatitlan material. Therefore, my
data contradict the statement of Nelson (<i>loc. cit.</i>) that the skulls of
<i>S. a. hypopyrrhus</i> are larger but proportionately narrower than those
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
of <i>S. a. aureogaster</i>. The constriction of the auditory bullae alluded
to by Nelson as being present in <i>S. a. hypopyrrhus</i> is also present in
<i>S. a. aureogaster</i>, occurring in both subspecies in varying degrees
without correlation with geographic distribution.</p>

<p>Actually, the only concrete evidence of geographic variation that
I can detect in these animals is a slight increase southwardly in the
frequency and degree of melanism, a kind of variation that is unworthy
of taxonomic recognition in this species. It seems best, then,
to regard the name <i>Sciurus aureogaster hypopyrrhus</i> Wagler as a
synonym of <i>Sciurus aureogaster aureogaster</i> F. Cuvier.</p>

<p>Nelson (<i>op. cit.</i>:45) stated that <i>S. a. frumentor</i> "Differs strikingly
from typical <i>aureogaster</i> in having well-marked nuchal and rump
patches of yellowish brown or rufous brown; the underparts gray
or gray washed with rufous; tail heavier and more bushy; pelage
softer.... Skull indistinguishable from that of typical <i>aureogaster</i>."
I have examined 22 specimens from Jico, 7 from Las Vigas
(the type locality), and one from 3 km. E Las Vigas, all in Veracruz.
These include the type and paratypes of <i>S. a. frumentor</i>. Part
(probably 7 specimens) of the series from Jico was referred by
Nelson (<i>op. cit.</i>:46) to <i>S. a. frumentor</i> and he thought, or knew,
these specimens to have been taken <i>above</i> Jico. The remaining
specimens labelled as from Jico were referred to <i>S. a. aureogaster</i>.
I am unable to find fault with the characterization of <i>S. a. frumentor</i>
insofar as color or skull are concerned. I cannot verify to my own
satisfaction the presence of "heavier" and bushier tail and softer
pelage. The characters considered to be diagnostic of <i>S. a. frumentor</i>
are distributed in an interesting geographic pattern the
genetic import of which is not wholly clear. One specimen (No.
23945 KU) of the two available from 3 km. SW San Marcos, Veracruz,
a locality on the coast approximately 50 miles north of Las
Vigas, is indistinguishable from topotypes of <i>S. a. frumentor</i> except
for slightly lighter-colored grizzled parts. The second specimen
(No. 23946 KU) from the same locality, although a subadult in
worn pelage, shows the color and striking dorsal pattern of <i>S. a.
frumentor</i> and the ventral color of <i>S. a. aureogaster</i>. The dorsal
pattern of <i>S. a. frumentor</i> is found also in the three specimens from
San Carlos and Plan del R&iacute;o, Veracruz (Nos. 11082, 11083 and
8278), Chicago Nat. Hist. Mus., respectively. (The two specimens
from San Carlos were referred to <i>S. a. frumentor</i> by Elliot, Field
Columb. Mus., Zool. Ser., vol. 8, Publ. no. 115:128, February 9,
1907.) Nevertheless, although the essential morphological characters
of <i>S. a. frumentor</i> occur sporadically in other populations, the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
animals from the higher elevations above Jico and Las Vigas are
notably homogeneous, differ collectively from surrounding populations,
and occupy a logical geographic range. Therefore <i>S. a. frumentor</i>
is retained as a tenable subspecies, and the animals from the
vicinity of San Marcos, and from San Carlos and Plan del R&iacute;o are
referred to <i>S. a. aureogaster</i>. Incidentally, Nelson (<i>op. cit.</i>:45) remarks
that he saw no melanistic specimens of <i>S. a. frumentor</i>. This
is not strange because melanistic specimens could not be identified
anyway.</p>
